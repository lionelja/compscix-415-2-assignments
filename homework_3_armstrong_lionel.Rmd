**3.8.1 Exercises**

*1.What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()


**ANSWER:**

The two variables ploted are both continuous variable.  The relationship between the two isn't very meaningful. The plot can be improved by mapping a categorical variable to an aesthetic such as color = drv.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color=drv)) + 
  geom_point()
```

*2.What parameters to  geom_jitter()  control the amount of jittering?*

**ANSWER:**

The height and width parameters control the amount of jittering.

```{r}
?geom_jitter
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color=drv)) + 
  geom_jitter(height = 40, width= 200)
```

*3.Compare and contrast  geom_jitter()  with  geom_count().*

**ANSWER:**

Jitter adds a small amount of variation to the location of each point to force the display of points that would otherwise be hidden because of overlapping values. The geom_count function counts the number of observations at each location and reflects the magnitude of the count by the size of the point.

```{r}
?geom_count
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_count()
```

*4.What’s the default position adjustment for  geom_boxplot() ? Create a visualisation of the  mpg  dataset that demonstrates it.*

**ANSWER:**

Position isn't useful for geom_boxplot.  The boxplot graphically displays the range of values of continuous variable, thus there are no overlapping points or bars. Specifying position has no impact on the boxplot position on the graph.

Help shows dodge is the default


```{r}
?geom_boxplot

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y=hwy))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y=hwy, position="identity"))
```

**3.9.1 Exercises**


*2.What does  labs()  do? Read the documentation.*

**ANSWER:**

The labs() function allows for the specification of the x and y axis labels and well as title and subtitle.

```{r}
?labs
```

*4.What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is  coord_fixed()  important? What does  geom_abline()  do?*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()


**ANSWER:**

The graph shows the cty and hwy variables move in unison. A increase in city mpg will aslo have an increase im highway mpg.

The coord_fixed function set the ratio between the physical representation of data units on the axis. On this graph it is important because the y and x axis represent the units being display (.i.e mpg). This eliminates any distortion by having the same representation.

The geom_abline adds a reference line of the y-intercept and slope to the plot.

```{r}
?geom_abline
 ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline()
 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_abline() 

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() 

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed() 
```
**4.4 Practice**
*1.Why does this code not work?*

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

*#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found

*Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)*

**ANSWER:**

The code does work. I was able to generate the error initially but after several modified executions it works. I'm unable generate the error.  Initially I thought the default class of a variable is character and the character value has to be enclosed in single quotes in assignment statement.

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_variable
class(my_variable)
```
*2.Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:*

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)

**ANSWER:**

```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

filter(mpg, cyl == 8)

filter(diamonds, carat > 3)

```
5.2.4 Exercises

*Find all flights that*
*1.Had an arrival delay of two or more hours*
  
   **ANSWER:**
  
```{r}
  TwoHourDelay <- flights %>% filter(arr_delay >= 120)
  TwoHourDelay
```
  
*2.Flew to Houston ( IAH  or  HOU )*
  
**ANSWER:**

```{r}
HoustonFlights <- flights %>% filter(dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))
HoustonFlights
```
'
  
  *3.Were operated by United, American, or Delta*
  
  **ANSWER:**
```{r}
SelectedOperator <- flights %>% filter(carrier == 'UA' | carrier == 'AA' | carrier == 'DL')
SelectedOperator
```
  
  *4.Departed in summer (July, August, and September)*
  
  **ANSWER:**
```{r}
DepartedSummer <- flights %>% filter(month >=7 & month <=9)
DepartedSummer
```
  
  *5.Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late*
  
  **ANSWER:**
```{r}
NoDelayArriveLateTwoHours <- flights %>% filter(arr_delay >120 & dep_delay == 0)
NoDelayArriveLateTwoHours
```
  
  *6.Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight*
  
  **ANSWER:**
```{r}
HourDelayMadeUp30Mins <- flights %>% filter(arr_delay <=30 & dep_delay >= 60)
HourDelayMadeUp30Mins
```
  
  *7.Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
```{r}
Departed_MidNight_6AM <- flights %>% filter(dep_time >=0 & dep_time <= 600)
Departed_MidNight_6AM
```


*2.Another useful dplyr filtering helper is  between() . What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?*



**ANSWER:**

The between function allows filtering of a range of values. Yes this can simplify coding of "greater than and less than" logic.

```{r}
?filter
Departed_MidNight_6AM <- flights %>% filter(between(dep_time,0,600))
Departed_MidNight_6AM
```

*3.How many flights have a missing  dep_time ? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?*

**ANSWER:**

There are 8255 flights missing dep_time. These rows might represent cancelled flights.

```{r}
Missing_Dep_Time <- flights %>% filter(is.na(dep_time))
Missing_Dep_Time
```

*4.Why is  NA ^ 0  not missing? Why is  NA | TRUE  not missing? Why is  FALSE & NA  not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? ( NA * *0  is a tricky* *counterexample!)*


**5.4.1 Exercises**

*1.Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select  dep_time ,  dep_delay ,  arr_time , and  arr_delay  from  flights.*

**ANSWER:**

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay,arr_time, arr_delay)
select (flights,  -(year:day),-(sched_dep_time), -(sched_arr_time),-(carrier:time_hour))
select (flights,  starts_with('dep'), starts_with('arr'))
select (flights,  ends_with('time'), -(starts_with('sched')), -(air_time), -(time_hour), ends_with('delay'))
```

*2.What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a  select()  call?*

**ANSWER:**

When a variableis included multiple times only one column is retuned by the select call.

```{r}
select(flights, dep_time, dep_time)
```

*3.What does the  one_of()  function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?*

vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

**ANSWER:**

The one_of function checks if one of a values in the vector of arguments is a variable of a data set. The vector can be used as the argument for the one_of function
```{r}
?one_of
varslist <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay","nhffh")
flights %>% select(one_of(varslist))
```

*4.Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?*

select(flights, contains("TIME"))

**ANSWER:**
Yes, the results are a surprise. I expected no columns to be returned because of uppercase characters.ignore.case = TRUE is the default and coding ignore.case = FALSE changes the default.

```{r}
?select
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```
