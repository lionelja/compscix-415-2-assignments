**3.8.1 Exercises**

*1.What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()


**ANSWER:**
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

*2.What parameters to  geom_jitter()  control the amount of jittering?*

**ANSWER:**

*3.Compare and contrast  geom_jitter()  with  geom_count().*

**ANSWER:**

*4.What’s the default position adjustment for  geom_boxplot() ? Create a visualisation of the  mpg  dataset that demonstrates it.*

**3.9.1 Exercises**


*2.What does  labs()  do? Read the documentation.*


*4.What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is  coord_fixed()  important? What does  geom_abline()  do?*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()


**ANSWER:**

**4.4 Practice**
*1.Why does this code not work?*

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found

Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

**ANSWER:**

*2.Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:*

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)

**ANSWER:**

**5.2.4 Exercises**

1.Find all flights that
  *1.Had an arrival delay of two or more hours*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *2.Flew to Houston ( IAH  or  HOU )*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *3.Were operated by United, American, or Delta*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *4.Departed in summer (July, August, and September)*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *5.Arrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *6.Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight*
  
  **ANSWER:**
  
  *7.Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)*
  
  **ANSWER:**


*2.Another useful dplyr filtering helper is  between() . What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?*

**ANSWER:**

*3.How many flights have a missing  dep_time ? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?*

**ANSWER:**

*4.Why is  NA ^ 0  not missing? Why is  NA | TRUE  not missing? Why is  FALSE & NA  not missing? Can you figure out the general rule? ( NA * *0  is a tricky* *counterexample!)*



**5.4.1 Exercises**

*1.Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select  dep_time ,  dep_delay ,  arr_time , and  arr_delay  from  flights.*

**ANSWER:**

*2.What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a  select()  call?*

**ANSWER:**

*3.What does the  one_of()  function do? Why might it be helpful in conjunction with this vector?*

vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")

**ANSWER:**

*4.Does the result of running the following code surprise you? How do the select helpers deal with case by default? How can you change that default?*

select(flights, contains("TIME"))

**ANSWER:**
