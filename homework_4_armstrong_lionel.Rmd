**5.6.7 Exercises**

*5.Which carrier has the worst delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about  flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()) )*

**ANSWER:**



```{r}
 flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% summarise(n()) 

```

*6.What does the  sort  argument to  count()  do. When might you use it?*

**ANSWER:**


```{r}
```
**10.5 Exercises**

*1.How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing  mtcars , which is a regular data frame).*

**ANSWER:**


```{r}

```
*2.Compare and contrast the following operations on a  data.frame  and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?*

df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
*

**ANSWER:**


```{r}

```
*3.If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g.  var <- "mpg" , how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?*

**ANSWER:**


```{r}

```
*6.What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?*

**ANSWER:**


```{r}

```

**12.3.3 Exercises**

*2. Why does this code fail?*

table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
  
 Error in combine_vars(vars, ind_list): Position must be between 0 and n >

**ANSWER:**


```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")

```
*3. 3.Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem?*

people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)


**ANSWER:**


```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)

```
*4. 4.Tidy the simple tibble below. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?*

preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

**ANSWER:**


```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)

```
**12.4.3 Exercises**

*1. 1.What do the  extra  and  fill  arguments do in  separate() ? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.*

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))


**ANSWER:**


```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")

```
*2.Both  unite()  and  separate()  have a  remove  argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to  FALSE ?*

**ANSWER:**

```{r}
table4a %>% 
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")

```
