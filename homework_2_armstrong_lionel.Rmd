**3.2.4 Exercises**

*1.Run  ggplot(data = mpg) . What do you see?*

**ANSWER:**  

Creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of  ggplot()  is the dataset to use in the graph. So  ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg)
```

*2.How many rows are in  mpg ? How many columns?*

**ANSWER:**  
Data set mpg has 234 rows and 11 columns. See glimpse below.

```{r}
glimpse(mpg)
```



*3.What does the  drv  variable describe?*

**ANSWER:** 

The drv variable describes the wheel drive be it f for front wheel drive or r for rear wheel drive or 4 for 4wd
```{r}
?mpg
```

*4.Make a scatterplot of  hwy  vs  cyl.*

**ANSWER:** 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```


*5.What happens if you make a scatterplot of  class  vs  drv ? Why is the plot not useful?*

**ANSWER:** 

The scatterplot displays a point for every occurrence of the intersection of the drv values and the class values. The hidden summary data being the count of the number of intersections isn't shown on the scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```

**3.3.1 Exercises**

*1.What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?*


ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
  
**ANSWER:** 

In the aesthetic mapping color is coded to add a third variable to a two dimensional scatterplot. Quotes are not used when specifying a variable. 

The correct coding is as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

To set the dots blue, color as an aesthetic is coded as follows:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

*2.Which variables in  mpg  are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type  ?mpg  to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg ?*

**ANSWER:**  

The categorical variables in mpg are: displ, trans, fl, class. The continuous variables are: year, cyl,cty, hwy. Running mpg will display the variable names and its class as columns. Character variables are categorical variables. Numeric and date/time variables are continuous variables.

```{r}
mpg
```


*3.Map a continuous variable to  color ,  size , and  shape . How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?*

**ANSWER:**  

The color aesthetic for a continuous variable is displayed as a gradation scale based on the variables value.

The color aesthetic for a categorical variable is displayed as a different color for each value/factor.

A continuous variable can't be mapped to the shape aesthetic..

The shape aesthetic for a categorical variable is displayed as a different shapes for each value/factor.

The size aesthetic for a continuous variable is displayed as relative size of the plot points to the value of the variable.
 
The size aesthetic for a categorical variable isn't advise. Showing each factor as different sizes doesn't add to the story being told.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))
```

*4.What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?*

**ANSWER:**  

When multiple aesthete tics are applied to the same variable the size, color, and alpha aesthetic are applied.  The shape aesthetic can't be applied to a continuous variable. The size aesthetic isn't advise for use with a categorical variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = hwy, size=hwy, alpha=hwy))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = hwy, color = drv, size=drv,shape=drv, alpha=drv))
```

*5.What does the  stroke  aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use  ?geom_point)*

**ANSWER:**

The stroke aesthetic works with points. The stroke aesthetic is used to change the boarder size of points.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, stroke = 5))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

*6.What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like  aes(colour = displ < 5)?*

**ANSWER:** 

The color aesthetic is applied to condition being true or false, that is, all points for which the condition is true are set to one color and the false points are set to another color.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ <5))
```

*4.Take the first faceted plot in this section:*

*What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?*

**ANSWER:** 

The color aesthetic has the disadvantage of not being a viable solution for presentation to color blind people and well as being difficult to differentiate color shade variations, Faceting has the advantage of presenting a focused view of the third variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```


*5.Read  ?facet_wrap . What does  nrow  do? What does  ncol  do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t  facet_grid() have nrow and ncol argument?*

**ANSWER:**

nrow controls the number of panel rows the plot charts are displayed
ncol controls the number of panel columns the plot charts are displayed

The facet_grid() doesn't have nrow and ncol arguments because the matrix of panels is defined by the faceting variables. 

```{r}
?facet_wrap
```

**3.6.1 Exercises**


*1.What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?*

**ANSWER:** 

Use geom_line to draw a line chart.
Use geom_area to draw a area chart.
Use geom_boxplot to draw a boxplot.
Use geom_histogram to draw histogram.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_area(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = displ)) 
```

*2.Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)


**ANSWER:** 

The graph will have two layers, one layer is a scatterplot and the second layer is a smooth line chart.  Both layers have the same mapping of x axis with displ variable and the y axis with hwy variable. Each factor of the drv variable will be displayed in a different color on the scatterplot. Gradients of color will designate the different factors of the drv variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```



*3.What does  show.legend = FALSE  do? What happens if you remove it?*
 *Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?*
 
**ANSWER:** 

The show.legend argument controls the display of the legend associated with a categorical variable.  Setting the argument equal FALSE removes the legend from the graph.

The show.legend explicit suppression of the legend was shown in contrast with the group aesthetics lack of providing distinguishable indication of the factor being represented by grouping.

*4.What does the  se  argument to  geom_smooth()  do?*

**ANSWER:** 

The se argument controls the display of the confidence interval.


*5.Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?*

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

**ANSWER:** 

The two graphs will look alike because the first graphs defined global aesthetic mappings that's applied to both layers. The second graph defines identical local aesthetics for each layer defined.  


**3.7.1 Exercises**
 Section 3.7.1: #2 only

2.What does  geom_col()  do? How is it different to  geom_bar() ?

**ANSWER:**

The geom_col creates a bar chart for a multivariate variable comparison and the geom_bar creates a bar chart for univariate variable. 

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
